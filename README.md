This is my first go at using machine learning! The idea behind this project was to create a useful & quick way to learn new technologies and practices.

## Working Examples

## The Data

I used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/shubhammehta21/movie-lens-small-latest-dataset) dataset from Kaggle!

## What I used

I used the KNN algorithm to compute similarity with cosine distance metric which is very fast and more preferable than pearson coefficient.
